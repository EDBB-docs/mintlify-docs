## What Coding Agents Solve

Professional software developers are in the business of solving problems with code. We are individual contributors primarily judged based on our ability to merge changes into the main branch of a repository.

However, we are also evaluated on our ability to ship things that people can actually use and understand. This requires us to complete the chore of writing documentation. A task is at best parenthetical to the "real work" of merging code and at worst a soul-crushing experience that makes us want to quit our jobs.

I find it ironic that I am employed by a company that provides tools to make writing documentation easier, yet still find myself procrastinating and dreading the task. Mintlify Agent was born from our team's personal experience with this feeling and desire to never face it again.

```bash
ip -6 addr show
